<I am performing calculations on "H2" in which I find the dimer and trimer equilibrium constants between 15-25
using the EOSs from miniREFPROP 10. I want to compare the results with stat mech calculations. In calculating 
the partition function for "H2", I want to be consistent with the convention used in the H2 EOS. In the miniREFPROP 
documentation, it is indicated that the EOS is for “normal” hydrogen, which I assume indicates that the ortho/para ratio 
is 3/1 at all temperatures. The NIST-JANAF thermochemical table for H2 (Chase 1998), however, is based on “equilibrium” hydrogen.
Of course for temperatures above ca. 200 K there isn’t much difference in data from the two conventions, but since I am working 
at low Ts, I want to be sure I’m calculating q_H2 correctly. Can anyone confirm this?

For example, stat mech calculations at 15 K give values for the rotational entropy of "H2" of 40.65 J/mol-K for the "normal" convention and 12/62 J/mol-K for the "equilibrium convention.
